    <p>Cyberpunk 2077 is an action role-playing video game developed by CD Projekt Red and published by CD Projekt. The
        story takes place in Night City, an open world set in the Cyberpunk universe.</p>
    <p>Players assume the first-person perspective of a customisable mercenary known as V, who can acquire skills in
        hacking and machinery with options for melee and ranged combat. </p>
    <p>The story follows V's struggle as he deals with a mysterious cybernetic implant that threatens to overwrite his
        body with the personality and memories of a deceased celebrity only perceived by V; the two must work together
        if there is any hope to separate the two and save V's life.</p>
